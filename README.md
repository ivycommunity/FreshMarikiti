## 🌟 Project Overview

### **What Makes Fresh Marikiti Different**
Fresh Marikiti isn't just another delivery app - it's a **hybrid model** combining traditional market logistics with modern technology:

1. **🔗 Connector-Centric Model**: Human intermediaries who physically shop in markets
2. **♻️ Eco-Points System**: Gamified sustainability with waste tracking
3. **🏪 Traditional Market Integration**: Tech bridge for non-digital vendors
4. **🌱 Waste-to-Value Pipeline**: Converting vendor waste into rewards
5. **👥 Multi-Role Ecosystem**: 6 distinct user roles working together

### **Core Business Flow**
```
Customer Orders → Connector Fulfills → Vendor Provides → Rider Delivers
                      ↓
              (Quality Check + Waste Logging)
```

### **Target Market**
- **Urban/Peri-urban professionals** who value fresh produce but lack shopping time
- **Traditional market vendors** who need digital access and logistics support
- **Middle-class families** seeking quality, sustainable food sourcing
- **Environmentally conscious consumers** interested in waste reduction

## 🔄 Unique Business Model

### **The Connector Advantage**
```
Traditional Delivery:     Customer → Restaurant → Rider → Customer
Fresh Marikiti:          Customer → Connector → Market/Vendor → Rider → Customer
                                      ↓
                              Quality Assurance + Waste Management
```

### **Why Connectors Matter**
- **🛡️ Quality Control**: Physical inspection before purchase
- **🗣️ Communication Bridge**: Real-time customer clarifications
- **♻️ Waste Management**: Log and convert vendor waste to eco-points  
- **🏪 Market Navigation**: Expert knowledge of local markets
- **📦 Order Accuracy**: Ensure correct quantities and freshness

```

## 📱 Mobile App Features

### **Completed Screens by Role**
- 🏠 **Customer App**: Home, products, cart, checkout (payment broken), orders, chat
- 🔗 **Connector App**: Dashboard, order management, market shopping, waste logging  
- 🏪 **Vendor App**: Product management, order processing, analytics (data broken)
- 🚴 **Rider App**: Available orders, delivery tracking (navigation incomplete)
- 👨‍💼 **Admin App**: User management (functions broken), analytics dashboard

### **State Management Issues**
```dart
❌ 9 Providers exist but state sync broken between them
❌ Cart state doesn't persist properly across sessions
❌ Order status updates don't reflect in real-time UI
❌ Chat messages don't sync with database properly
❌ Location updates don't trigger in all dependent screens
```

## 🔌 API Features

### **Working Endpoints**
```
✅ POST /api/auth/login      # Authentication works
✅ GET  /api/products        # Basic product retrieval
✅ POST /api/orders          # Order creation (partial)
✅ GET  /api/users/profile   # User profile data
```

### **Broken/Incomplete Endpoints**  
```
❌ POST /api/payments/mpesa  # M-Pesa integration incomplete
❌ PUT  /api/orders/:id/status # Status updates don't sync
❌ POST /api/chat/messages   # Chat persistence issues
❌ GET  /api/analytics/*     # Analytics aggregation broken
❌ PUT  /api/waste/log       # Waste logging incomplete
```

## 🌍 Environment Configuration

### **Demo vs Real Data Issues**
The app currently switches inconsistently between demo data and real API calls:

```bash
# Current configuration script
./scripts/switch_device_config.sh auto    # Works for network setup


**Problem**: No clear separation between demo and production data flows.

## 📊 Business Logic

### **Commission Structure** 
```javascript
Rider Commission: 5% of delivery value
 
Vendor Earnings: Remaining amount after commissions
```

### **Eco-Points System (Needs Integration)**
```javascript
// Current calculation (incomplete)
Earning Rate: 1 eco-point per 100 KES spent
Waste Bonus: 5-20 points per kg of waste logged by connector  //////real info will be given by me, Ramadhan or Zivai in the whatsapp group
Redemption: 1 eco-point = 1 KES value

// Missing: Connector waste logging → vendor eco-points pipeline
```

### **Connector Workflow (Incomplete)**
```javascript
Order Assignment → Market Shopping → Quality Check → Waste Logging 
    ↓
Eco-Points Calculation → Rider Handoff → Order Completion
    
// Issue: Steps 3-5 need proper implementation
```
